                        The history of Italy covers the Ancient Period, the Middle Ages and the modern era. Since
                        classical
                        antiquity, ancient Phoenicians, Greeks, Etruscans, and Celts have inhabited the Italian
                        Peninsula, with
                        various Italic peoples dispersed throughout Italy alongside other ancient Italian tribes and
                        Greek,
                        Carthaginian, and Phoenician colonies.[1][2] In antiquity, Italy was the homeland of the Romans
                        and the
                        metropole of the Roman Empire.[3][4] Rome was founded as a Kingdom in 753 BC and became a
                        Republic in
                        509 BC, when the monarchy was overthrown in favor of a government of the Senate and the People.
                        The
                        Roman Republic then unified Italy at the expense of the Etruscans, Celts, and Greeks of the
                        peninsula.
                        Rome led the federation of the Italic peoples, and later dominated Western Europe, Northern
                        Africa, and
                        the Near East.

                                <img src="rome1.jpeg" width="90%" height="auto">
                                Colosseum, also called Flavian Amphitheatre, giant amphitheatre built in Rome under the
                                Flavian
                                emperors. Construction of the Colosseum was begun sometime between 70 and 72 CE during
                                the reign of
                                Vespasian. It is located just east of the Palatine Hill, on the grounds of what was
                                Nero’s Golden
                                House. The artificial lake that was the centrepiece of that palace complex was drained,
                                and the
                                Colosseum was sited there, a decision that was as much symbolic as it was practical.
                                Vespasian,
                                whose path to the throne had relatively humble beginnings, chose to replace the
                                tyrannical emperor’s
                                private lake with a public amphitheatre that could host tens of thousands of Romans.

                                The Roman Forum, also known by its Latin name Forum Romanum, is a rectangular forum
                                surrounded by
                                the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center of the city of
                                Rome.
                                Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the
                                Forum Magnum,
                                or simply the Forum.

                                Augustus. It was
                                rebuilt by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated c. 126
